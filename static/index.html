          <strong>Geofolio is a small project with a big vision: to 
          make the world's environmental data accessible and understandable for 
          everyone (2019-present).</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Environmental data is notoriously difficult to use if you're not an 
          expert. It gets hidden away in unusable "data portals" and 
          without some serious GIS skills it is difficult to use this data for
          your own purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Geofolio simplifies this. It has only one step: Select an area on 
          Earth that you're interested in. It will then automatically generate
          a factsheet for you about that area containing basic information about land 
          cover, elevation, hydrology, soils, and crops. All data is downloadable
          in accessible GIS formats for further exploration.

          <strong>Using Open Geodata to Detect Deforestation and Land Use Change Hotspots (2021).</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Together with the SourceUp platform at IDH we developed a methodology to detect
          deforestation and land use change hotspots based on data by Global Forest Watch,
          Mapbiomas, Copernicus Land Cover Products, and Planet/NICFI satellite imagery.
        </p>
        <p>
          A PDF report is generated with the hotspots. For each hotspot sattelite imagery 
          from Planet is collected from just before and after the change for verification
          and validation purposes.

          <strong>Snapspace is a simple collaboration space for groups (2018-2020).</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Snapspace was a departure from applications built on geodata, and is a simple 
          ephemeral online collaboration space for groups, where you could easily invite 
          other members across different organizations and share documents, images, messages, 
          and events. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately Snapspace never gained any traction and has stopped accepting new
          signups since 2020.
